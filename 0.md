## NOTES 
- We still have a number of details we need to figure out:
	- clarification about the idea of legal status of ODR, and whether it can exist outside of jurisdictional contexts
	- need to feel confident that a specific process can be legally binding regardless of jurisdiction
	- WE NEED A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE

- We think there are 4 main components to the arbitration problem:
	- the stake/agreement formation
	- the arbiter curation/selection
	- the making of decisions by arbiters
	- the appeals process

- how do we manage coordination
	- every 4 months, split into working groups for different topics 
	- a steward for each working group
	- keep the core group amongst the 3 teams in it right now
	- core group defines where research goes for the next phases
	- make it transparent - publicly summarize what we discuss in private calls
	- if you don't like us, fork us!

- staking - need to do user research
	- we should come to consensus on an interface that works for all parties involved
		- different function implementations based on different rulesets	- need a verbose interface, modular enough to change different parts of the process


### TODO:
- set up a discourse group
	- ETHMagicians forum? - might bring in too many philosophers/ people not close to the problem space who just want to speak their mind on any forum that will listen
	- forums are a great format- you can have discussions on topics at length
	- self-hosting discourse - forum.edra.network
- figure out an interface for staking
- publishing a follow up blog post that kicks off the first epoch
